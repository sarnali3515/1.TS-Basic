    /*
    You are given an object representing a book with properties title (string), author (string), and publishedYear (number). Use type alias for declaring the object. Write a TypeScript function called isRecentBook that takes this book object as input and determines if the book was published in the last 5 years.

    Hints: Use getFullYear() method to extract the year to check the given year with current year.

    Sample Input :
    const book1: Book = {
        title: "Sample Book",
        author: "John Doe",
        publishedYear: 2022
    };
    isRecentBook(book1);

    Sample Output: 
    true
    */

    type Book = {
        title: string;
        author: string;
        publishedYear: number;
    };

    function isRecentBook(book: Book): boolean {
        const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
        return currentYear - book.publishedYear <= 5;
    }

    const book1: Book = {
        title: "Sample Book",
        author: "John Doe",
        publishedYear: 2022
    };

    console.log(isRecentBook(book1));
